# Predict whether a Free Learning Plan user would convert to a paid subscriber or not.

## Introduction to the data challenge

365 Data Science is an online learning platform specializing in data science courses.

👨‍🎓 👩‍🎓 Students learn by watching video content, then evaluate their knowledge by taking quizzes, practice exams, course exams, and career track exams.

🎯 The challenge is to build a machine learning model to predict whether a Free Plan user would convert to a paid subscriber or not.

## Data

The data is a collection of 11 .csv files
- 365_student_info.csv
- 365_student_purchases.csv
- 365_student_learning.csv
- 365_course_info.csv
- 365_course_ratings.csv
- 365_student_quizzes.csv
- 365_quiz_info.csv
- 365_student_exams.csv
- 365_exam_info.csv
- 365_student_engagement.csv
- 365_student_hub_questions.csv

## Exploratory Data Analysis (single datasets)

-	The 2 main student countries are India and the US.
![Number of students per country](images/Nb_students_per_country.png?raw=true "Nb students per country")
-	There are 5 main subscription peaks corresponding to 365 data science special events like Winter Sales 2022. There is also a lesser peak for the platform gamification introduction.
![Number of subscriptions over time](images/Nb_subscriptions_over_time.png?raw=true "Nb subscriptions over time")
-	There are 2 registration peaks in June and mid-August. They are also related to 365 data science special events, respectively Data Science Summer Campaign 2022 and Most Wanted Campaign.
![Number of registrations over time](images/Nb_registrations_over_time.png?raw=true "Nb registrations over time")
-	There is a peak of video watching mid-august.
![Number of days of video watched over time](images/Nb_video_watched_days_over_time.png?raw=true "Number of days of video watched over time")
-	Almost all courses are well noted. We should not get much information from those ratings.
![Course ratings distribution](images/Course_ratings_distribution.png?raw=true "Course ratings distribution")
-	In the exam info table, there are a lot of missing values for the exam category. It could be interesting to know which exams are course/career track exam vs practice exam. We might infer those category by relating exam completion date with course watched in the days preceding the exam.
-	Students generally convert after 2 weeks after entering the platform (this assumption was also provided in the guided instructions).

## Data modeling & ML-ready dataset building

From the last insight, I decided to build the ML-ready dataset based on student registration and their behavior for the next 14 days. The target variable being the boolean “subscribed” during this 14 days period.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (ML-ready dataset)

💡 The target variable (subscribed) is very imbalanced:
- 6% of the students subscribed within the first 14 days after registration
- 94% did not

![Target variable distribution](images/Subscribed_distribution.png?raw=true "Target variable distribution")

Here are the relationships between the target variable and 2 others variables:
- Average exams score
- Number of days with video watching within the first 14 days after registration

![Target variable & Average exams score & Number of days with videos](images/Corr_target_var_and_avg_exam_res_and_watch_days.png?raw=true "Target variable & Average exams score & Number of days with videos")

💡 We can see that the more you watch videos, the more you convert to a paid subscriber. 
There seems to be also a link with the average exams score.

Here is the correlation matrix:

![Correlation matrix](images/Corr_analysis.png?raw=true "Correlation matrix")

💡"Average exams results" and "is engaged with exams" are very correlated features.
💡"Engagement_days" and "is engaged with exams" are very correlated features.
"Average exams results" and "Engagement_days" features are removed from the dataset.

Here are all pairplots for all features couples:

![All relationships](images/Relationships_between_variables.png?raw=true "All relationships")

💡 Watched days and engagement seems correlated.

## Choice of the evaluation metric

As I get eventually a very imbalanced classification (6% who subscribed/94% who did not subscribe), I have to choose the right evaluation metric. Accuracy should not be used as any naïve algorithm that would predict “100% student did not subscribe” would get around a 94% accuracy… 

I used the recall metric instead. I could have used other metrics for imbalanced dataset such as imbalanced accuracy, F1 or F2 score. Recall is the fraction of subscribed students that are successfully retrieved (TP/(TP+FN)).

The other tricks for imbalanced classification to preserve the same ratio of the target variable in different sets are:
-	stratified splits for train/test split
-	stratified K fold for validation

## Model building

I evaluated 4 classifiers: 
-	Logistic regression
-	KNN
-	Random Forest
-	LightGBM



## Final comments

What I could have done (if time permits):
-	During EDA, I haven’t performed any hypothesis testing.
-	During preprocessing, 
-	Oversampling

I am wondering if 365 Data Science experiment A/B testing: does gamifications increased engagements and then subscriptions?
